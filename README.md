===============

Based on the specifications for our Market Street project, we created a data model that simulates the flow of buses, cars, trucks, and pedestrians along the Market Street corridor. The model contains many patterns and events based on actual data that collected in late January 2014. The data set contains 160,000 data points describing two weeks of pedestrian and vehicular circulation across four intersections on Market Street, San Francisco in a 1 minute temporal resolution. You are welcome to add third-party data to this data set  http://urbandatachallenge.org/urban-data-canvas/
